Some information about a checkers board

It is an 8x8 board

A light set of pieces and a dark set of pieces

Each set has 12 pices placed on the dark squares of the first 3 rows

The dark colour goes first


Notes for jumpChecker

Always called in findPotenialMoves, is void, just adds to an arrray (thank you for memory)
Ignores everything that isnt an opposite pieice
If an opposite piece is identified,
function calculates if a valid jump is there (e.g if the space in the same direction as the opposite
is empty)
If jump is valid, it marks it adds it to the list of potetial moves (which will become grey squares)
add adds the tile that it jumped to a "Jumped List" stored within Cell object
Any jumped cells from the current cell in the function is also added to the this list

The functon then calls itself on the new grey cell.

If no valid jump is found then the function returns without adding anything to the grey list
